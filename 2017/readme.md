In this repo you'll find a handful of scripts used to install and configure SQL Server. This is intended to have a uniform and consistent SQL Server installation and thus environment.

This is by no means ideal and the scripts are DUMB so you must be careful using them. Work in progress, but it greatly reduced the deployment, configuration and  verification time.
